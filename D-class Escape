In the LCZ where the D-class go to get assigned jobs, the master assignment cards are just sitting out, it's quite easy to break the glass, get inside and use one to give yourself a non d-class rank and just stroll through the doors, I think it would be best to change it so you're incapable of changing your rank from D-class through those consoles or make security keep the cards on hand.
